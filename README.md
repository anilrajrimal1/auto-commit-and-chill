# Auto Commit and Chill

Welcome to **Auto Commit and Chill**, the coolest way to automate your GitHub commits like a boss! 🚀

### What is it?
This project automatically commits and pushes changes to your GitHub repository, so you can focus on the fun stuff and leave the repetitive tasks to the robots. 🤖💻

### Features:
- Automatic commits every 2 hours (because, why not?) ⏰
- Pushes changes directly to your repo. No more "manual" pushing. It's like magic, but real. ✨
- Works seamlessly on GitHub Actions (and locally too, if you prefer to live dangerously). 🏠

### How Does It Work?
1. Create or update a file (I'm using `anil-magic.txt` for example – because it’s magic).
2. Commit and push those changes to your GitHub repo. 🏆
3. All automated. No humans involved (except when setting it up, obviously). 😎

### Getting Started:
1. Clone this repo: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anilrajrimal1/auto-commit-and-chill.git
   ```
2. Add your **GitHub Access Token** as a secret in the GitHub repo.
3. Set up your SSH key for GitHub (IDK why HTTPS, couldn't authenticate).

### Schedule:
- Runs automatically after every 2 hours.

(But feel free to manually trigger it via GitHub Action’s UI when you want it to do its thing. 🔥)

### Why Should You Use This?
- **Procrastination level**: Expert 🏆
- **Productivity level**: 1000% 📈
- **Stress level**: Zero 👌

Just sit back, relax, and let this little script handle the rest. 😎
